              The East Coast became my home for half a year as I finally settled into a routine that does not involve packing, hiking backpacks, or planes. I was a few train stops from my family and was greeted with a smile and a song every morning by Derek at Copley Station. I ran in the afternoons around the Charles River and took long walks around the Boston Common with Beny. It's also the place where I witnessed terrorism for the first time at the Boston Marathon just a few days after I was lectured about 9/11 in Global Studies. That time I felt personally concerned and hurt by the unfortunate situation. The beauty of Boston and pureness of Boston made me fall deeply in love with it, I felt personally touched when the bombing occurred a block away from my residence. At the time, I was at the finish line of the Marathon representing an Alzheimer organization when we re suddenly evacuated  due to an emergency. Fortunately we made it home safely and were all glued to our smartphones following different news channels. Due to a man hunt, Boston was on lockdown for 48 hours until they finally arrested the terrorists. A few days later, things started to become normal again but I was mainly astonished by the city's sense of community and union. Terrorism scratched the pride of Boston on April 15th, 2013, but the love, the beauty, sense of community, and union of the city remained intact.
