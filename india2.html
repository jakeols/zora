              Alixr was a pilot company created for the tea project. The aim of this project was to create a tea company from scratch and pitch the idea to a panel of potential investors. The tea was to be imported and produced in Munnar, India where we spent a week learning about the tea making process before we began our business plan. Hypothetically, alixr was a small tea shop in New York, which offered a variety of tea flavors from all across India coupled with store merchandise. As teenagers and young adults are the target audience of the company, alixr sought to create a hub for the them to inspire and get inspired. As this was only a school project, alixr never actually open its doors but I am more than happy to announce that the young entrepreneurs behind the project were granted funding by their investors.
