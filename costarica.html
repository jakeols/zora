              When our leadership team announced that we were going to be on campus in the middle of nowhere for eight weeks, the first thought that came to my mind was “Holly scheisse, not again!” My Indus experience was still fresh in my mind, and being trapped in the middle of nowhere surrounded by wild animals is not my cup of coffee – especially because I don’t like coffee.

    Growing up, my biggest childhood nightmare was to put my hand under my pillow and find a scorpion. Little did I know, this nightmare would become my everyday life for eight weeks.  To be fair, the campus was absolutely stunning – the flora and fauna seamlessly blended together in different shades of colors. The wooden bungalows contrasted the green in the trees and the radiant blue in the sky and sheltered the scorpions on the rainy days.

    My attitude towards nature completely changed as evenings rolled one after the other. I have previously mentioned, nature is not my comfort zone; I’m a city girl at heart. I was born and raised in the city and had gotten accustomed to breathing in polluted air and being stuck in traffic for endless hours. UGA was located right in the middle of the rain forest, to get to the nearest town you had two options: hike for 3 hours, hitchhike for the whole day (cars we not that common), ride a bus for an hour. It was on the bus ride back to San José that I realized how much I actually loved that place. I had gotten accustomed to rice and frijoles for every meal, Tony’s pizzas, cold showers, bugs, snakes, scorpions, and sharing my classroom with a family of tarantulas.  Oh and I almost forgot, my rubber boots. Thank you for being loyal and protecting my toes from the wilderness and all that comes with it.

    PS: Cover up on windy day because you might get a scorpion flying into your face.
