              As we were saying our final goodbye, I closed my eyes and let the sound of Joann's voice guide me. I opened my eyes, still listening to Joann but this time around I was in India. The smell of curry and saffron rice was invading our venue. I looked around me and realized my time as a freshman had come to an end. I was decently traveled, no longer a newbie, and had added a fourth language under my tool belt.

              India is a bit of blur to be quite frank. I'm currently sipping on this weird detox smoothie and I don't think it's helping remember much. Okay, let's see....

              Home was Indus International Boarding School, and I hated home. At home, I wore uniforms everyday and the PE uniforms was rough. Literally, rough. The fabric was so stiff I felt like I was getting scrubbed all day. So gross. I compensated by splurging in traditional India clothing. I wrapped myself in my newly purchases silk saris and pure Kashmir scars, which currently have no use what so ever. But at the time, it was so worth it.

              In a true TGS fashion, we journeyed off across India as well. We spent endless hours on bus rides and let me tell you this, you'd be surprised by the things you come up with when you're on a bus with 45 people for over 10 hours. Also, you don't have internet, you're exhausted, and just ready to get to your final destination but guess what you still have another 5 hours ahead of you. So what do you do? Umm, well you've got options: fashion shows, bus surfing, rap freestyles, and the list goes on.

              The travels made me forget my and other people's misery at home. India is a magnificent country with a lot of colors and flavors that I was more than lucky to experience.

              Four months later, I had visited: Hyderabad, Amritsar, Bhopal, New Delhi, Agra, Ajanta, Ellora.
