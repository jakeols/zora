              New Zealand is also a big foggy, and just to update you I changed locations. I am still in Florence but this piece is written at Blac. Super cute place, highly recommend it… shitty Wi-Fi though.

    New Zealand was my first term as an IB student so the joy of exploring and doing fun projects was gone. Even when I tried to do those things I had this weird feeling of guilt, all I could think about was the mountain of assignments I had to submit.

    I was based in Auckland but traveled around the country for a bit. My most memorable trip was to the South Island, which was totally out of my comfort zone. I think at this point I made it clear that nature is not really my thing. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s beautiful but I just miss the smell of pollution, the warmth of my sheets, and my five hundred pillows. No offense to those who love nature, as I said… I think it’s very pretty. I spent five days kayaking from island to island and replaced my five hundred pillows with Cameron’s arm, the warmth of my sheets with Julia’s breath, and my light bulbs with Sydney’s iPhone.

    For five days I woke up to the sound of waves colliding with the pebbles in the sand, and the perfume of salt in the leaves, which reminded me of my mother’s floral summer sent. My routine completely shifted. Instead of spending endless hours checking Instagram and Snapchat, I sad of the golden sand and admired the beauty of the mountains I was going to hike later during the day.
