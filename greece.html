              Athens captured my soul and took my appendix. (In case you were wondering that’s been my Instagram bio for close to a year cause I’m totally not over what happened.)
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    Just a few days after my arrival in Athens, I started experiencing what was about to become the weirdest thing that had ever happened to me thus far. I didn’t even get enough time to finish romanticizing about the beauty of Greece and the myths that I found myself getting cut open at Euroclinic.
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    I was diagnosed with Acute Appendicitis and had to get an emergency surgery immediately. This all happened in Greece, home of philosophy, art and drama, therefore I decided to refer to the situation as a tragedy.

  <h5>Quick Literature/TOK Lesson:
</h5>
<p class="flow-text">
  Aristotle defined peripeteia as a “tragic shift of fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy.” The protagonist (me) not only had to get an organ removed but had an important presentation, which determined the fate of her Extended Essay (EE). This EE determined the successful completion of her International Baccalaurteate diploma, which was also necessary for university.

  Being the smooth talker she is, she tried to negotiate herself out of the clinic to do her presentation. The surgeon made it crystal clear that he was the boss and the only way out of Euroclinic was without my appendix.

  A few hours before the surgery, she walked out onto the balcony and started out at the Acropolis. The sun caressed her cheeks. She was completely convinced she was going to die. As She signed her life away to a team of surgeons, she asked the anesthesiologist, “what if I don’t wake up? I’ve seen it on Grey’s anatomy, which means that it’s legit. It happens, right?” Shaking his head, he face-palmed and then put me under.

</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  She did wake up.

</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  Thank God.

  In fact, She woke up to the voice of Tashi asking her if she remember what he asked the waiter in Costa Rica. That was the most painful laugh she had ever experienced.
