<p>"Happiness is something very special, everybody Bhutan believes in it in their own ways, as they have their own perspective. Money is definitely not the only thing that can make people happy, not only in Bhutan but all around the world. If a teacher spends an hour or more explaining a lesson to his students and at the end he realizes that everyone feels confident and fully understood a new concept, he will leave his classroom with a smile on his face. Even by doing the simplest thing like wishing a good morning to a random person in the street brings you a feeling of comfort, which could be interpreted as happiness." -Jigme Drukpa.

After the South Atlantic Ocean, the Eastern Himalayas called my name as embarked into a different journey in the Land of The Thunder Dragon. Bhutan, one of the smallest countries in the world landlocked between the world's most populated nations, China and India. I spent two weeks traveling around the Himalayan roads, I came out with this resolution:
<br>
<br>
1. Altitude sickness really sucks <br>
2. You can survive with no internet <br>
3. Always figure out a way to contact your family back home otherwise they automatically think you're dead <br>
4. Bhutan blew off Gross National Product for Gross National Happiness <br>
5. Do NOT eat a red chillies unless you're brave <br>
6. Your DSLR is your best friend <br>
7. Don't drink too much water if you're going on a super long bus ride but stay hydrated (go figure)<br>
8. Empty your memory card every night and BACK IT UP! <br>
9. Eat food and more food <br>
10. If you're gluten free, dairy free, and hate rice your life is gonna suck for two weeks. Have fun! <br>
